I'm working on writing math formulas in python, but I'm having trouble. Can you help me fix them?

Operations in Python:
    addition: a+b
    subtraction: a-b
    negation: -a
    multiplication: a*b
    division: a/b
    integer division: a//b (returns a/b with the decimals chopped off)
    exponentiation: a**b (returns a to the b power)
